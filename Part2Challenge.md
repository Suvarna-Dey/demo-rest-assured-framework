#Part 2 Challenge

###Improvements in Quality for Team A:

1. While Kanban retrospectives are not mandatory, I feel it is important to practice it to get feedback for continuous improvement. 
2. Unit test coverage should be increased as it is base for test pyramid. The higher number of unit tests, better is the code quality. Also, there should be a tool to track the coverage like SonarQube.
3. There is no test coverage for Rest API which can be improved by adding some component/unit level tests.
4. No test coverage for web apps on Safari Browser/Cross browser testing.
5. No test coverage for Performance, security or accessibility testing.

###Improvements in Quality for Team B:

1. No backlog grooming.
2. As this team seems to work backend APIs mostly, there could be changes in contracts that could break the consumers. It would be good to have contract testing in place to avoid the non communicated hiccups.
3. No Non-functional test coverage or security test coverage.
4. The engineers should be able to test the feature on their own laptop without depending the shared environment using Docker. This promotes the shift left approach and also removes the dependency on a shared environment. This will promote the shift left culture in the team.
